# Strike Finance Perpetuals Smart Contract

## What are Perpetuals

Perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the continuous price movement of an underlying asset without an expiration date, enabling positions to be held indefinitely. These contracts typically offer leverage, meaning traders can control larger positions with a relatively small amount of capital by essentially borrowing, which amplifies both potential gains and losses. To manage the increased risk associated with leveraged trading, perpetual futures require maintenance marginsâ€”minimum account balances that must be maintained to keep positions open.

There are two positions that a trader can take: a long and a short. Traders will open a long position when they think the underlying asset will go up in value and a short position when they think it will go down in value. To open a position, the trader will need to deposit USDM as collateral for opening short positions and the underlying asset for opening long positions. When they close their position, they will be able to keep all the profits plus the collateral back. Any losses that occurred will be deducted from their collateral.
