## What are Perpetuals

Perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the continuous price movement of an underlying asset without an expiration date, enabling positions to be held indefinitely. These contracts typically offer leverage, meaning traders can control larger positions with a relatively small amount of capital by essentially borrowing, which amplifies both potential gains and losses. To manage the increased risk associated with leveraged trading, perpetual futures require maintenance marginsâ€”minimum account balances that must be maintained to keep positions open.

There are two positions that a trader can take: a long and a short. Traders will open a long position when they think the underlying asset will go up in value and a short position when they think it will go down in value. To open a position, the trader will need to deposit USDM as collateral for opening short positions and the underlying asset for opening long positions. When they close their position, they will be able to keep all the profits plus the collateral back. Any losses that occurred will be deducted from their collateral.

## Perpetuals on Strike

Opening a position does not involve buying or selling of the underlying asset. Instead, our Liquidity Providers (LPs) serve as the counterparty to every trader's position; when a trader profits, the funds are paid from the liquidity pool, and when they incur losses, those funds are absorbed back into the pool. There are also no funding rate mechanism common in perpetual futures. Traders compensate LPs for enabling these synthetic positions by paying a hourly borrow rate. 100% of liquidated funds goes back to lps. Over a long period horizon liquidity providers will earn a profit over the traders due to things like opening fee, closing fee, liquidations, and borrow fees.
